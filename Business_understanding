###The Business Background
Jaya Jaya Institute is a private higher education institution that has been operating since the year 2000. As an organization in the education services sector, its primary mission is to produce competent graduates who are ready to compete in the job market. Over more than two decades, the institute has built a strong reputation for delivering high‑quality graduates who meet industry needs.However, like many other educational institutions, Jaya Jaya Institute faces challenges in maintaining a high graduation rate. One of the most significant issues is the high number of student dropouts—students who discontinue their studies before completing their academic programs. This problem affects not only the institution’s reputation but also its financial stability and long‑term operational sustainability.To maintain educational quality and ensure business continuity, the institute has begun adopting a data‑driven approach to identify students who are at high risk of dropping out. Through this approach, the institution can design targeted interventions such as mentoring programs, counseling services, and academic support. This strategy represents both an innovation in educational services and a strategic effort to improve student retention and reduce dropout rates. Overall, the business context of Jaya Jaya Institute reflects its ongoing commitment to maintaining educational quality, financial sustainability, and student satisfaction amid the increasing challenges and competition in the higher education landscape.
